## A website that allows users to create a list of their favorite movies. The site utilizes the top 250 rated movies from the IMDB API, as well as any movies the user wishes to add.

## Features:
 - Communicated with the IMDb Movies API to render an array of the 250 top movies and display them within cards
 - Incorporated “favorite” function that allows users to add desired titles to a separate array
 - Integrated HTML form that allows the user input their own movies
 - Introduced user view history through callback functions within the cards



## Challenges:
  - Accessing and implememnting nested arrays and objects
  - Page alignment once functionality was established
  - Applying event listeners to objects within the same html class
  - Proper management of global variables

## Limitations:
  - Database did not hold movie descriptions
  - Lack of knowledge with GitHub lead to over-the-shoulder partner coding
